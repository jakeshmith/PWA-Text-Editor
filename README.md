# PWA Text Editor
Created by Jake Smith

## Project Description
This nifty little application is a text editor that lives in the browswer. When the user goes to the website's web address, they are presented with a text editor that they can use
for any text-typing needs. When they leave the website and come back, the things they typed are still there! The user can also download it as an app, to be used offline. This 
allows them to open it directly from their device's homepage.

## Technologies Used
This application relies heavily on the use of webpack to bundle several javascript modules together at once. It uses caching, a web manifest, and a service worker to create a PWA,
which is the reason why it can be used when the device is in an offline state. All of this is built on a typical node.js/Express structure.
